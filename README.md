# What are subnets

There are different sizes of subnets which depends on connectivity and the technology.
- Point-to-point subnet allows two devices to connect
- data center subnet might be designed to connect many more devices

Subnets break large networks into smaller, more manageable networks that run more efficiently

each subnet is a logical subdivision of the bigger networks

connected devices within a subnet share a common IP address identifier - communications

Routers manage communication between Subnets

This allows IP address reallocation

Relieves network congestion

Better security
- subnet segmentation within an organisation stay local.
